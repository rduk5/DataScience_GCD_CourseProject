# DataScience_GCD_CourseProject
##### Project takes two sets of data from the machine learning repository at UCI 
##### Data is called "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set"
##### The data consists of training and test data that need to be merged into a clean data set for analysis
##### The R script called run_analysis.R in this repo performs this merging and cleaning in the following steps

###### 1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
###### 2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
###### 3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
###### 4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
###### 5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###### The final data is available by running the run_analysis.R file on the source data (output of step 5 above)
###### Exact process the code does is detailed in the comments within the run_analysis.R code
